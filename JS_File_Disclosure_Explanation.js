// For the integrity and continued improvement of the plugin, I've decided to keep the JS files private at this time. This decision is rooted in several considerations. Firstly, proprietary algorithms and unique techniques used within the code are intellectual assets that need protection. Public exposure might make them vulnerable to misuse or plagiarism. Secondly, the nomenclature used in the code was never designed with open-source dissemination in mind. There are method names and terminologies, like using "triple" where one might expect "double", which were established during initial design phases for internal clarity. Sharing the code as-is could lead to confusion and misinterpretation, amplifying the communication overhead with the developer community. Furthermore, open-sourcing it without a full review could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities which could be exploited by malicious actors. Maintaining the quality and reputation of the plugin is paramount, and preventing fragmentation or unofficial modifications helps ensure that users always get the intended and consistent experience. I hope everyone understands and respects this decision, and I assure you that the core functionality and performance of the plugin will remain uncompromised.
